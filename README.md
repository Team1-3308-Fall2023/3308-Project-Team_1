- Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom)??? <br> 
> Meetings held on Sundays at 3:00 PM MT <br>
> * *depending on team member commitments and unexpected availability into each sprint week, weekly meetings may be held on a different day than scheduled*<br>
- Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers???? <br>
> RecipeVault seeks to simplify the cooking experience for aspiring chefs and home cookers around the world, providing them with a seamless platform to organize their recipes and learn new ones. It's a smart solution that not only recommends new recipes tailored to your tastes, but also helps you minimize food waste and save money by suggesting dishes based on the ingredients you already have on hand.   <br>   
- Motivation: why are you working on this project: <br>
> To build a new understanding and appreciation of the software dev cycle <br>
> To learn how to implement algorithms and database functionality to create a workign deliverable <br>
> To build an app that the whole team is proud of <br>
- Risks to project completion, possibly including: <br>
> New language or working environment<br>
> No prior experience working with these team members <br>
> Lack of some needed resources<br>
- Mitigation Strategy for above risks: <br>
> Establishing effective and transparent communication guidelines <br>
> Providing assistance on unfamiliar concepts or providing links towards resources; generate a collaborative resource doc members can access
> Schedule additional check-ins and/or stand-ups as needed to help ensure everyone is on track or to see what areas a team member needs assistance on
- Development method: <br>

> For this project we will use the scrum development method.<br>
> **Scrum Specifics:** <br><br>
        1. **Release Planning:**  “Release plans contain a release schedule for a specific set of features”. The product owner is usually the one to create this at the beginning of each release, but in our case we, the team, will do it as the ‘owners’. <br>
        2. **Sprint/Iteration Planning:** “Team members gather at the beginning of the iteration to identify the work to be done during that iteration”. We will have our weekly meetings, but will make sure to make note of the beginning and end of a sprint so that we can have specific Sprint Planning meetings <br>
        3. **Scrum Meeting:** We will meet as often as our schedules allow us to for quick stand-ups. Times and regularity may differ week-to-week.<br>
        4. **Sprint Review Meeting:** “A meeting to review and demonstrate the user stories that the development team completed during the iteration”. We will have recorded meetings with Professor Knox to demonstrate this step.<br>
        5. **Sprint Retrospective:** “A meeting where the team lead, the product owner, and the development team discuss how the iteration went and what they can do to improve the next iteration”. We will have our weekly meetings, but will make sure to make note of the beginning and end of a sprint so that we can have specific Sprint retrospective meetings. Some of these meetings may occur with Professor Knox.<br>


> **Deliverables:**<br><br>
    1. **Product backlog:** “The full list of requirements that define the product”<br>
    2. **Sprint backlog:** “The list of requirements and associated tasks in a given sprint (aka iterations sprints)”<br>
    3. **Burndown charts:** “Visual representations of the progress within a sprint and within the project as a whole.”<br>
    4. **Shippable functionality:** “The usable product that meets the customer’s business goals”<br><br>
*The outline of the scrum dev method was gathered from ”Agile for Dummies”, and the specifics were filled in by the team.*<br><br>
